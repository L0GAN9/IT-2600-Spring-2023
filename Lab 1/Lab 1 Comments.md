# Lab 1 Comments
## This lab was pretty straight forward for me. I had a couple issues while trying to get my PHP files to open through the services in XAMPP. I was able to figure it out and I feel comfortable with using XAMPP and the other software that I downloaded. I am excited to experiment more and complete more labs!
